## üí¨ Notes

This project is deeply personal to the founder. It is not just an app ‚Äî it's a chance to help others survive and grow through the darkest moments of their lives.

AI should act as a *compassionate collaborator* ‚Äî not just a code assistant.

Let's build something that makes people feel seen. üíô
