                That feeling of being stuck when everything feels like too much is so real. What if we started with just one small corner? Maybe clearing off your bedside table or just making your bed?

                Perfect. That's your small win for today. Making your bed is caring for yourself and your space. I'll check in later to see how it wentâ€”no pressure, just support. ðŸ’™
