When my world fell apart, well-meaning people offered advice: "Just make a to-do list." "Set some goals." "Stay productive." But here's what they didn't understand—when you're barely surviving, productivity apps feel like a cruel joke.

## The Problem with Productivity Culture

Most apps are built for people who already have their foundation intact. They assume you wake up motivated, that you have energy for "crushing goals," that you can handle the pressure of streaks and badges and notifications.

But what happens when you're in grief? When trauma has rewired your brain? When depression makes even basic tasks feel impossible?

**Traditional productivity tools become another source of shame.**

## A Different Approach

Small Wins for Healing isn't about optimization—it's about survival and gradual rebuilding. We start where you are, not where you think you should be.

Instead of asking "How can you be more productive?" we ask:
- How are you feeling today?
- What would feel manageable right now?
- What would count as a win, however small?

## Why This Matters

Recovery isn't linear. Healing isn't efficient. And that's exactly why we need tools designed for the messy, non-linear reality of putting your life back together.

Your small wins matter. They add up. And you're not alone in this journey.
