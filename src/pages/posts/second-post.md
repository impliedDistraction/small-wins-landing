There's actual science behind why small wins work better than big goals when you're recovering from trauma, loss, or depression. It's not just feel-good psychology—it's neuroscience.

## Your Brain on Trauma

When we experience trauma or prolonged stress, our nervous system gets stuck in survival mode. The parts of our brain responsible for planning, motivation, and executive function literally go offline.

This is why someone can tell you to "just make a plan" and it feels impossible. Your brain isn't being difficult—it's being protective.

## The Neuroscience of Small Wins

Small accomplishments do something magical: they activate the brain's reward system without overwhelming the stressed nervous system. Each tiny success:

- **Releases dopamine** (the motivation chemical)
- **Builds neural pathways** associated with capability
- **Strengthens the prefrontal cortex** (executive function)
- **Reduces cortisol** (stress hormone)

## Why Traditional Goal-Setting Fails

Big goals require a lot of mental energy and executive function. When your nervous system is dysregulated, attempting large goals often leads to:
- Feeling overwhelmed before you start
- Self-criticism when you "fail"
- Reinforcing the belief that you're "not capable"

## The Small Wins Alternative

Instead of "I need to get my life together," we focus on:
- "I made my bed"
- "I drank a glass of water"
- "I took three deep breaths"

These aren't lesser achievements—they're the building blocks of recovery.

## Building Your Foundation

Think of small wins like physical therapy for your motivation system. You start with tiny movements and gradually rebuild strength. There's no shame in starting small—there's wisdom in it.
