Most apps want to change your behavior. We want to understand your humanity.

## The Problem with "Optimizing" Humans

The tech industry loves to talk about "optimizing" human behavior, as if we're machines that just need better algorithms. But when you're dealing with trauma, depression, or grief, optimization isn't just unhelpful—it's harmful.

**People aren't problems to be solved. They're humans to be supported.**

## Our Design Philosophy

Every feature in Small Wins for Healing starts with one question: "Would this feel supportive to someone who's struggling?"

We don't use:
- ❌ Guilt-inducing notifications
- ❌ Shame-based "streaks"
- ❌ Pressure to be consistent
- ❌ One-size-fits-all advice

Instead, we built:
- ✅ Gentle check-ins that honor your reality
- ✅ Celebrations that meet you where you are
- ✅ AI that learns your patterns without judgment
- ✅ Flexibility for bad days (and good ones)

## Trauma-Informed AI

Our AI isn't trying to motivate you to be someone else. It's trying to understand who you are right now and what might feel manageable today.

When you tell the app you're having a hard day, it doesn't suggest a workout. It might suggest taking five deep breaths. Or making a cup of tea. Or just acknowledging that today is hard and that's okay.

## The Human Behind the Code

I'm not building this app as a tech entrepreneur who saw a market opportunity. I'm building it as someone who needed it and couldn't find it anywhere.

Every line of code is written with the memory of my darkest days—when even opening an app felt overwhelming, when every notification felt like pressure, when I needed technology to feel more human, not more efficient.

## Progress Over Perfection

Small Wins for Healing isn't about becoming a "better version of yourself." It's about becoming a supported version of yourself. There's a difference.

We're not here to fix you. You're not broken. You're human, and being human in a difficult world is hard enough.
